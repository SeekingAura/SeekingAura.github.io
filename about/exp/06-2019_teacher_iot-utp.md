In December 2018, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Systems and Computation Engineering (Computer Science). Then, in January 2019, I started my Master degree in Systems and Computation Engineering (Computer Science) focused in Deep Learning, Big data and Cloud computing. At the same time, the research group GRANDE, of which I was a member, offered me the opportunity to work as a teacher. They wanted to participate in *"extension courses at UTP"* These extension courses provide monetary support if the project meets the conditions for *"Contribution to social development through university outreach"* In this case, the project was *"Fundamentals of Internet of Things"* which was approved and received monetary support.

In that project, I worked as a teacher of IoT, where I taught the following topics:
* Basics of Programming with Python
* Basics of Raspbian Management (a common OS used on Raspberry Pi)
* Basics of Electronics
* Basics of Communication Protocols
* Project: Smart Garden
* Project: Detection and Measurement of On-Site Activity

I also wrote and published a handbook containing the course content, which can only be accessed for students of course and students of the university. I taught this course four times in 2019 and i worked on this project from January 2019 to November 2019.

# Skills/Tools
* Python
* AdafruitIO
* RPIGPIO
* Raspberry Pi
* Electronic Sensors
* IOT
* Linux
* Raspbian
* SSH

When I completed my Bachelor of Systems and Computation Engineering (Computer Science) in December 2018, I decided to start my Master's in Systems and Computation Engineering (Master in Computer Science) in January 2019. At the same time, the research group GRANDE (Grupo de Avanzada en Desarrollo de Software), where I was a member, offered me the opportunity to participate in a new project to teach an IoT course. This course will be financed by the university through the project *"Contribución al desarrollo social a través de la extensión universitaria"*

Then I accepted the project. The group leaders gave me some books and materials to create the theoretical content. They also provided me with 10 Raspberry Pi devices and the sensors I requested based on the course content I had designed.

On This project about teach the *"basics/fundamentals of the Internet of Things using a Raspberry Pi"*. I had these responsibilities:
{: .text-justify}
* Write and publish a handbook containing the course content.
* Assist students in developing their course projects.
* Design promotional materials for the course, such as posters. Promote in classrooms to students and teachers, and then they advertise through person-to-person communication to other students also persons outside of university.
* Test Raspberry Pi and electronic sensors owned by the research and investigation group GRANDE, CIDT (Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo). Ensure they are stored correctly and still work properly after every course session.
* Constantly keep the course's theoretical information up-to-date and continually improve the usage of sensors and Raspberry Pi in course projects.


All of my work was supervised by Teacher Carlos Alberto Ocampo Sepulveda (nickname CAOS), a member of the research group GRANDE.


# IOT Course - Fundamentals in the Internet Of Things over Raspberry Pi

The IoT theme attracts a lot of attention because, in the future, technological innovation has potential uses for data mining and data analysis with many small devices like fridges, washing machines, and any electronic domestic device that has an internet connection. This potential has allowed me to reach the maximum student capacity (at that moment was 40) every time I taught the course.


This course is designed for anyone who wants to learn about IoT. In this case, you will learn about:
* Fundamental information about IoT, theory, use cases, future live usage
* Basics of programming with Python
* Basics of operating systems (OS)
* Basics of electronic sensors
* Basics of communication protocols, both electronic and programming

All of these topics are explained with the minimal required information to make a simple implementation and understand the projects implemented during the course. The main objective of this course is to cover the main topics of Industry 4.0, with IoT being a significant part of technological innovation at that moment.

The best project in the course was the smart garden because the usage of sensors are closer to examples of real commercial usage. These sensors interact well with the environment, and this project uses most of the theoretical information explained at the beginning of the course, such as getting data from the environment through electronic sensors, sending data to a platform using the MQTT protocol, analyzing the gathered data, and performing actions based on the data's behavior.
