Before attending university, I engaged in academic [mechatronics](https://itspereira.edu.co/product/mecatronica/) projects at the [Instituto Técnico Superior de Pereira](https://itspereira.edu.co/). These projects included a light-following robot, a line-following robot, and other programs created in PIC-C and assembly language with Microchip technology, specifically targeting the PIC16F628A microcontroller. Currently, I have not been able to locate photographs or the software that I developed there. However, it is crucial to note that these experiences marked the beginning of my entire career.

Additionally, I served as an Office Assistant (required social work at the Instituto Técnico Superior de Pereira for graduation). At that time, I was quite young for formal employment, being only 14-15 years old.
