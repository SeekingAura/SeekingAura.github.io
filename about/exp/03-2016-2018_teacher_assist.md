This photo shows the computer science lab where I taught about IoT using the Raspberry Pi 3 in 2019.
{: .notice}

Not only i help help students of the teachers that i was assigned also i enjoy to help any that come to the computer lab asking for help and i try to my best, also learning some new things by other careers like Electricity, Electronics also Industrial administration

# How Was the Work Assigned?
Each academic semester, the Systems and Computational Engineering program asks its teachers if they need a Teacher Assistant for the next semester and how many. If they do, the program typically reappoints the same Teacher Assistant from the previous semester for the job.

Once the semester starts, the teacher provides their Teacher Assistant with the study plan for their course that they will be teaching, including the most important topics where students may need assistance. Additionally, students are informed that if they require further help with their studies in that course, they can visit during specified hours to seek assistance from the assigned Teacher Assistant.

In my case, I was assigned for six consecutive semesters to two different courses: Compiler Construction and networking with CISCO.

# Course Compilers
From February 2016 to November 2017, I was assigned to the compiler course how Teacher Assistant. In this course, students learn how compilers work and apply their knowledge of grammar and formal languages, including regular expressions. They delve into compiler code analysis, covering different aspects such as:
{: .text-justify}
* Lexical analysis
* Semantic analysis
* AST - Abstract Syntax Tree generation

![Compiler illustration](/assets/img/work/compiler_illustration.jpeg){: .align-right}
Typically, students implement their own compiler with Python using the [SLY module](https://pypi.org/project/sly/), based on the rules of any language specified by the teacher. Here, students are encouraged to apply the best practices they have learned about data structures (especially graphs for AST generation) and algorithms. This course is an excellent opportunity for students to thoroughly understand how compilers function, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I work how **Teacher assistant** of this course by 4 consecutive semesters

# Course Cisco
![CISCO partner utp](/assets/img/work/NetworkingAcademyPartner-logo-utp.png){: .align-left}
From February 2018 to November 2018, I was assigned to the 'Networks with CISCO'. In this course, students learn about networking concepts including **IPv4**, **IPv6**, **VLANs**, and they also complete **CISCO exams/tests** (multiple-choice questions) and lab projects. For these projects, they configure switches and routers according to the lab work, both virtually with the **CISCO** simulator and physically in the **CISCO** computer lab, which is outfitted with the necessary routers, switches, and computers for the course, this is because the Universidad Tecnologica de pereira is a Networkign Academy partner of CISCO https://crie.utp.edu.co/servicios/administracion-de-servicios-especiales-mediados-por-tic/academia-cisco/.

I served as a **Teacher Assistant** for this course for two consecutive semesters. These semesters were my final ones in the Systems and Computational Engineering program
