Before university, I developed several academic [mechatronics](https://itspereira.edu.co/product/mecatronica/) projects at the [Instituto TÃ©cnico Superior de Pereira](https://itspereira.edu.co/), such as a light follower, line follower, and others programs made in PIC-C and assembler with Microchip (impact into PIC16F628A). At the moment, I have not found photos or the software that i developed there, but it is important to mention that this is where my entire career began.
