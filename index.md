# How to Read This Site
At the top of the website, there is a sidebar where you can find the main topics of the site. Click on any theme that interests you, such as:
* Developer Notes
* About
* Gaming Notes

Most pages will have a navbar on the left side of the website. There, you can find various topics and click on any that you wish to explore. As you browse, the navbar will update to show the subtopics of the section you are in.

**I will update whenever possible. Enjoy!**

**To-Do:** Add a search bar.
