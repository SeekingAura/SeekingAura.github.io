Linux servers are among the most common servers used today for several reasons, including customization, open-source nature, and more. It is very important to have control over most aspects of your system, and Linux systems offer that possibility. They also allow you to manage every single part of the system. With this, you can install and set up only the things you really require, resulting in a lightweight system without unnecessary bloated software.

Ubuntu and Debian-based distros are among the most commonly used. Most shell and bash commands work similarly between these systems. While some commands might also work on other Linux distros like Red Hat, I will cover those in separate documents because I can only guarantee that they work on Ubuntu or Debian distros.

These notes are based on the official documentation of Ubuntu commands (like [man](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/) command info) and are supplemented by information from forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/) and blogs like [Medium](https://medium.com/) about the usage of different commands.
